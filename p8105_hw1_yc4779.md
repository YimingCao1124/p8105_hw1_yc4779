# Problem 1 — early_january_weather

``` r
# Load the dataset
data("early_january_weather")
weather <- early_january_weather
```

**Description:**  
The dataset contains **358 rows** and **15 columns**.  
Key variables include:  
- `time_hour` (timestamp of the observation, POSIXct format)  
- `temp` (temperature in °F, mean = **39.58**)  
- `humid` (relative humidity, ranging from 0 to 1)  
Other variables include `wind_speed` (mph), `visib` (miles, visibility),
and `pressure` (millibars).

``` r
# Scatterplot of temp vs time_hour colored by humidity
p_temp <- ggplot(weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "NYC Early January: Temperature vs Time (Color = Humidity)",
    x = "Time (hourly)",
    y = "Temperature (°F)",
    color = "Humidity"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
p_temp
```

**Plot description:** The scatterplot of temperature versus time shows a
clear daily cycle, with higher temperatures during the day and lower
temperatures at night. Periods with higher humidity (darker colors) tend
to coincide with milder temperatures. In addition, short-term
fluctuations are visible, reflecting changes in weather systems over the
days.

``` r
# Save the plot to figs folder
if (!dir.exists("figs")) dir.create("figs")
ggsave("figs/temp_vs_time.png", p_temp, width = 8, height = 5, dpi = 300)
```

# Problem 2 — Variable types and coercion

``` r
n <- 10
df_types <- tibble(
  norm_samp   = rnorm(n),                          # numeric
  is_positive = rnorm(n) > 0,                      # logical
  char_vec    = sample(letters[1:5], n, TRUE),     # character
  factor_vec  = factor(
    sample(c("low","medium","high"), n, TRUE),
    levels = c("low","medium","high")
  )
)
df_types
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    norm_samp is_positive char_vec factor_vec
    ##        <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>    <fct>     
    ##  1    0.674  TRUE        e        high      
    ##  2    1.31   FALSE       d        low       
    ##  3    0.115  FALSE       b        high      
    ##  4    1.07   TRUE        b        high      
    ##  5    0.155  TRUE        b        low       
    ##  6    2.12   TRUE        c        low       
    ##  7   -0.219  TRUE        e        high      
    ##  8   -0.113  FALSE       b        medium    
    ##  9   -0.0651 FALSE       c        high      
    ## 10    0.476  TRUE        a        low

``` r
mean_numeric <- mean(pull(df_types, norm_samp))
mean_logical <- mean(pull(df_types, is_positive))

list(mean_numeric = mean_numeric, mean_logical = mean_logical)
```

    ## $mean_numeric
    ## [1] 0.5520184
    ## 
    ## $mean_logical
    ## [1] 0.6

The numeric variable can be averaged directly. The logical variable is
treated as 0/1, so the mean corresponds to the proportion of TRUE
values. Character and factor variables cannot be averaged because they
do not have inherent numeric meaning.

``` r
logical_num <- as.numeric(df_types$is_positive)  # TRUE→1, FALSE→0
char_num    <- as.numeric(df_types$char_vec)     # character→NA
factor_num  <- as.numeric(df_types$factor_vec)   # factor→level codes (1,2,3)
```

Logical variables are converted to 0 and 1, which explains why their
mean equals the proportion of TRUE values. Character variables convert
to NA because they have no numeric mapping. Factor variables convert to
their underlying integer codes (1, 2, 3), which are just labels and do
not carry real quantitative meaning.
